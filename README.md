# OTP encryption/decryption toy
Toy for kids to encrypt/decrypt messages with one time pads (OTP). They can encrypt a message sent via Messenger, SMS or something else. And receive and decrypt.

In addition to handle encryption/decryption it will take care of creating and distributing one-time pads and make sure pads are erased after use.

This way it will be harder for corporations to aggregate user knowledge and police/authoroties to invade their privacy. But also teaching kids about keeping safe will be a win I think.
